#Employee Reviews: Database
##Danai && Jennifer
#####(get it ,&&, because we're in a ruby class)

##Overview
This program creates a database that stores information about employee's for a company and the departments they work for. We modified an existing program and converted it to a database so that the information could be saved. 



###Issues:
- Unfinished palindrome method, I feel we are close just not quite there
- Probably needed a little more time physically as a team to get through all the tasks; however our "tag team" method once we left the campus did work well and we were still able to communicate well.
