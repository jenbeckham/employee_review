#Employee Reviews
###Description
This program uses an *employee class* and *department class* to store object information for evaluating reviews for employee performance and raises.

###How does it work?
To create an employee object the following are used:
- name
- email
- phone
- salary

After the employee is created, a review can be added to evaluate the employee's performance through "Satisfactorily/Unsatisfactorily" or rating.

An employee can be assigned to a newly created department object.

The department can be used to give multiply employees raises based on different criterial such as ratings, current salary, etc.

All these methods were developed through TDD (test-driven development).

###Issues:
- Distributing salary by ratio based on performance.
- Passing test with incorrect answer.
